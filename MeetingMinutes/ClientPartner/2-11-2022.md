## Topics Discussed
- AccuTech is happy with what we've identified as our fourth iteration requirements:
  - Style frontend
  - Return on Investment Section
  - Emergency Fund Strategy Section
  - Investment Strategy Section
  - Connecting with Cheetah API
  - Signing Line on PDF

- Have we hit your "must haves" for this project?
  - Yes, now we are getting into "nice to haves"
  - Ensure that you are meeting Ergin's "must haves" before this project ends.
    - We can discuss further if you'd like, but for now we have the most important things already.
      - Biggest thing they identified so far was frontend, but we're free to pursue what we think is best.

#### Overall Client feedback:
- We've met big goals for this project thus far, now is satisyfing Ergin and doing something creative to "own" our project.

## Things Clarified
- Feel free to reach out to AccuTech if there is something urgent that needs addressed following our meeting with Ergin on Tuesday, 2/15.
