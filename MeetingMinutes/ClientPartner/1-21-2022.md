## Topics Discussed
- Scott discusses and visualizes what an IPS statement typically looks like.
  - See document Scott emailed us: `IPS format default language and optional responses.docx`

- Equity = Stocks
- Stable Income = Bonds

- Flexibility is appreciated, but getting the barebones content down first is more than fine.

- In the near future we will be asked to demo our project to Matt and Scott's boss.
  - No exact date on this yet, but something to keep in mind.

## Things Clarified

- Signature can be done via a cursive font that is typed.
  - Gravy would be to support something like Docusign where a digital signature could be drawn with a mouse
    - Cursive text is 100% fine for our purposes.
