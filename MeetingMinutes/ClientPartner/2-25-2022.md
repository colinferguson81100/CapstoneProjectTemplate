## Topics Discussed
- We updated AccuTech on what we've been working on recently and what we're recently accomplished.
- We still feel good about the goals we set for this iteration.
- We let AccuTech know that our iteration is due March 10.

## Things Clarified
- Client should know their Cheetah Account Number
  - Accuont Numbers are not standardized, as Cheetah allows for customization (ex: everything made this year starts with a 2022)
  - Account numbers are unique however.
