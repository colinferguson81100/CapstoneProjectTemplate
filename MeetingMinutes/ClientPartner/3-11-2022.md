## Topics Discussed
- We demonstrated our iteration to AccuTech to get their feedback.
  - Scott is happy with where we are and is excited for us to eventually demo our project to others at AccuTech.
    - He did not have much to add beyond that and preferred to talk about iteration five.
- We then briefly discussed plans for iteration five.

## Things Clarified
- AccuTech is satisfied with what we have and is giving us large amounts of freedom for what to work on during iteration 5.
  - We plan to accomplish the following:
    - Refactor code
    - Improve styling of frontend
    - Improve appearance of PDF
    - Add QoL features to frontend quiz (buttons in consistent spots, larger sizes, quiz scales with window size, etc.)

- Reminder: we will meet with AccuTech leadership team to demonstrate our finished product once it gets closer to the end of the semester.
  - Possible Atendees:
    - Phillip Yu, Director of Products
    - Linc Mitchell, Executive Director of Operations
