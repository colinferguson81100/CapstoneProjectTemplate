## Topics Discussed
- Accutech already has access to all code, so there's that we really need to do.
- We sent Accutech the Github documentation via email.

## Things Clarified
- Accutech plans to use our code in production sometime in the near future.
- They thank us for taking the project seriously and they look forward to maybe working alongside us someday!
- If we ever need anything, we're welcome to drop them a line. Referrals, etc.
