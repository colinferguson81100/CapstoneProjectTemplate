## Topics Discussed
- Cookies in frontend questionnaire?
  - Client still doesn't deem it necessary. They'd rather us focus on something else.
  - Questionnaire is intentionally short so potential loss of progress is negligible.
  - Very low priority for now.

- Fifth Iteration Features look good for now, but they'll discuss before our next meeting to make sure we aren't forgetting anything.
  - Client is happy for us to work on refactoring internal code and establishing tests.

## Things Clarified
- Colin was sick today and let us know he was unable to attend.

  - Possible Atendees:
    - Phillip Yu, Director of Products
    - Linc Mitchell, Executive Director of Operations
    - Dan Wright, Executive Director of Strategy
    - Adam Unger, President (potentially)
