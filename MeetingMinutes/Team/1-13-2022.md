## Topics Discussed

- Caught everyone up on what's happened over break and our plans going forward.
  - How do we get both of our repos to launch with one Docker command?
  - Making our code more modular, readible, and commentated.
  - Clarifying which features to focus on for this upcoming iteration:
    - Testing
    - Connecting to Cheetah API
    - "Default Text" implementation (as requested by Scott and Matt)
      - We plan to ask them for some examples of the default text during tomorrow's meeting.

- AccuTech might be looking closer at us soon to determine if we're worthy hires or not.
  - May be worth keeping that in mind while working.
  - Might be a good idea to update our resumes at some point too.

## Things Clarified

- Went over plans for this iteration.
- Discussed things we want to clarify during our meeting with AccuTech tomorrow.
- Discussed whether our 2:30 PM Friday meeting time worked for everyone this semester (it does)!
