## Topics Discussed

- Cheetah API Validation
  - Make sure this is an option though, not required (it would violate modularity)

- Frontend Data Validation
  - Ensure total amount in asset allocation page doesn't exceed total amount of assets
  - Present a "suggested" set of values as a default based on Risk Tolerance, allow modification if desired.

- Consider adding a loading wheel or something to let users know their click to download the PDF was acknowledged.

- Consider modifying the font on the landing page to give off a slightly more serious tone.

- Known issue: downloading a PDF takes a really really long time currently.
  - We're working with Kade to resolve this. Right now we're requesting every account from Cheetah's API which takes a very long time (> 14k responses).

- Exploration into making frontend text inputs submit their value on keypress (so JSON is never out of date / syncing skipped)

- Plans made to meet tomorrow (2/24) at 3:00 PM

## Things Clarified

- Try to meet tomorrow with Kade or Evan, whoever is available (accomplish mentor meeting requirement).
