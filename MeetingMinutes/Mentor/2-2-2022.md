## Topics Discussed
- Evan helped us fix our frontend (it ran on some machines but not everyone's).

- Evan demonstrated the value of Git Kraken to us. It is what AccuTech uses to make commit tracking easier.
  - Evan recommends against using command lines because it makes things harder.
  - Evan also recommends against pushing code without getting it reviewed by a teammate.

## Things Clarified

- Evan likes where we are, but we are planning to meet with him again in the next few days so we can properly demo our project to him for feedback.
- As a team we're going to crank out the last few feature for this iteration and then look forward to the next iteration.
