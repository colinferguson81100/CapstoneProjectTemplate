Kaleb

## Topics Discussed
- Demonstrated our project to Evan since he was not present at the Client meeting like he usually was.
  - He thinks it looks good.

- We then discussed our plans for iteration five with Evan.
  - He likes what we're targeting for the final iteration.
    - He told us that his team had similar amounts of freedom during their last couple iterations as we are having now.
  - Evan thinks ironing out some of the "good enough" stuff will take our project from intern level work to something that looks professionally crafted.

## Things Clarified

- Plans for Iteration 5:
  - Improved PDF appearance via styling and formatting changes.
  - Give PDFs a more meaningful default name rather than "file.pdf"
  - Alter frontend questionnaire elements to scale with window size
  - Add some indication that a PDF is being generated and the user should wait
