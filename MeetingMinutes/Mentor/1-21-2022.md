## Topics Discussed
- Evan goes over the IPS example document that Scott gave us earlier that day.
  - (See document Scott emailed us: `IPS format default language and optional responses.docx)

- Equity = Stocks
- Stable Income = Bonds

- Scott mentioned that we might be demoing our code to AccuTech soon, so we asked Evan if he had tips for that.
  - He said it should just be incentive to work on the project to make it as good as we can.

## Things Clarified

- Evan thinks we're in a good spot, but it would benefit us to keep our foot on the gas.
  - Speculation: doing well demoing the project to AccuTech may help our chances of getting a job offer in the future?
