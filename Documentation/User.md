## Risk Tolerance Page

The point of this page is to calculate the user's risk tolerance through a quiz. Each question has a specific value given to each of the answers. Once the users go through the entire quiz all of the values are taken and then used to evaluate and determine the level of risk that user has. Once the user has their risk tolerance they may retake the quiz or continue on.
