# How to use InvestAway

##Landing Page

This page is pretty simple, all you have to do is press START to start the application.

##Goals Page

The point of this page is to keep track of the user's investment goals. You can type in your name and check whatever investment goals apply to you. Once your done you can press CONTINUE to go to the next page.

##Risk Tolerance Page

The point of this page is to calculate the user's risk tolerance through a quiz. Each question has a specific value given to each of the answers. Once the users go through the entire quiz all of the values are taken and then used to evaluate and determine the level of risk that user has. Once the user has their risk tolerance they may retake the quiz or continue on.

##Final Page

The point of this page is to take the user's input from the goals page and the risk tolerance page and use that to generate a personalized IPS. All the user has to do to generate the IPS is to click the button.
