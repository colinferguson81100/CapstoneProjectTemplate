# Setup
## Backend Setup
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://sanaugler@bitbucket.org/accutechdev/bsu.ips-generator.backend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd bsu.ips.generator
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  dotnet restore
```

## Frontend setup
Having issues with npm run serve, so until I can figure out what is wrong follow these steps to run the frontend

1. in console type : npm install -g @vue/cli (add sudo to the beginning of the line if on linux)

2. in console type : vue ui

3. in vue ui import frontend repository

4. once the repo is in the projects tab click on the project

5. click on tasks

6. click on serve

7. click run task

8. go to localhost:8080/#/landing
