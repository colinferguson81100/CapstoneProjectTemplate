# Setup

## Setup the frontend and backend. (clone locations don't matter).

### Backend Setup 
```bash
    git clone https://sanaugler@bitbucket.org/accutechdev/bsu.ips-generator.backend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
    cd bsu.ips.generator
```

Install dependencies

```bash
    dotnet restore
```

### Frontend setup
Having issues with npm run serve, so until I can figure out what is wrong follow these steps to run the frontend

### Clone the frontend repository onto your computer
### Install Vue CLI with this command in a terminal: npm install -g @vue/cli
### Start the Vue CLI with this command in a terminal: vue ui
### Once the Vue CLI opens import the frontend repository into the Vue Project Manager
### Once the project is imported click on the project link to take you to the project dashboard
### Click on tasks
### Click on serve
### Click run task
### Once the app builds go to localhost:8080 to get to the project

## runthrough 
1. go through the frontend and make a pdf
1. pdf file should be donloaded through your browser
