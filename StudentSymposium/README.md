- The Student Symposium was an interesting experience because it allowed me to see many capstone projects that I otherwise never would have had the opportunity to see, and I like to imagine that's how other people felt about our project! I kind of wish there was more people around so there wasn't as much dead time during the event, but that's being nit picky. I'm interested to see what future events – such as the colloquium or the spring banquet – have to offer!
